# PlanMe
A platform to simplify group project organization

## Purpose: 
This web application will serve as an easy-to-use platform for users to create, manage and track group projects.


## Confirmed Features:
- Create an outline for a group project.

- Assign sections to members of a group. 

- Members can update their progress by submitting work or by self reporting progress.

- Overview of the project's progress.


## Potential Features:
- Anonymously rate each other’s work, which could be used to help with grading.

- Also, if a student hasn’t submitted anything or updated their progress it could send emails/notifications to remind them to be productive.

- Target dates for subsections of a project.

- Comments on a piece of work (commit).

- Time tracking? (time logged in to the platform = how much time you commit to a project).
