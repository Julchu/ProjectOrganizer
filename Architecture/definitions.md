| PlanMe                        |PlanMe is a web application that organizes group projects. The application allows users to create projects, invite members, and manage tasks. Other platforms enable members to communicate but this web app keeps members focused. This is done by showing users active tasks and member participation. A quantifiable way to track work and progress is sometimes needed when working in a group.On the other hand, threads and messages allow members to communicate about goals and issues.All together PlanMe enables users to be their best and most efficent while working together.                 |

| Kanban                        | Japanese for "billboard") methodology - an agile method of project management focusing on the visalization of workflows, balancing demand and a team's resources for maximum efficiency. |
| Task                          | A trackable and achievable user defined goal. Each task has an effort level, descriptor and status. There may be multiple tasks inside every taskboard. |
| Task descriptor               | a colour descriptor to allow users to visually group tasks together of the same colour. |
| Task status                   | visually seen by a task's location within the Kan-Ban style TaskBoard. The status may be To-Do , In-Progress or Done. |
| Task effort level             | A number descriptor for every task. May be from 1-5. the intent of effort level is to encourage members to work on tasks of a higher effort level or to describe their complexity.|
| Taskboard                     | The area in which the user can view each of their to-do, in-progress and done tasks. There may be multiple task boards for every project. |
