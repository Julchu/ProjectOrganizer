<h1>PlanMe Post-Mortem</h1>

<b>Author:</b> Braydon Kains

**NOTE**: Due to the informal nature of this document, it will be written in the voice of author Braydon Kains to more easily convey ideas and situations.

In this document, we will discuss the challenges of PlanMe's development. We will start by going over what went well, before going into the technical challenges of each individual team, and finishing by discussing overall managerial challenges.

<h1>Strong Parts of Development</h1>

<b>Architecture:</b>
The Architecture portion of our development cycle was very strong overall. We had a strong basis for our Architecture team, and nearly every other member of each other team was able to contribute with content and SQA. We had great success coordinating meetings, and everyone pulled their weight. 

<b>Front End:</b>
Later on in the document you will read a multitude of developmental challenges related to the Front End development. It should be made very clear that this is not to do with any individual member of the Front End team. We had a very strong and creative team of people working on PlanMe's Front End. Under better direction, this team would've thrived far more than they were allowed to under the circumstances. Everyone had excellent ideas for our artistic direction that were unfortunately not properly coordinated until the final moments of development.
The strongest technical portion of Front End's development was the final coordination of the views. When each member of the team had finished their assigned views, Josh Jacob took on the task of making up for the team's lack of direction. While preserving as much of each member's original vision and work as possible, Josh combed through each view to integrate Bootstrap and add consistent styling to each view to make each view as consistent with each other as possible. He managed to salvage what could have been a large problem for final implementation, and PlanMe would not be the same without this work.

<b>Back End:</b>
The Back End team had a very similar set of issues to the Front End team, but also had the same advantages. The team was always willing to pull their weight, and in the final moments of development were instrumental in finishing the final working product presented on Monday. They were also an extremely adaptive team, finding game-time solutions to a wide variety of unexpected obstacles constantly. Like the Front End team, they would have thrived far more under more coordinated direction.
The strongest technical portion of Back End's development would be the team's final decision on how to simulate the object oriented design required by the project. In choosing Node.js, it wasn't immediately obvious that the team was in for quite a hassle attempting to simulate this Object Oriented design in Javascript. What the team ended up with however worked very well. The team admits that it may be inefficient in comparison to completely abandoning the idea of using objects. That being said, the objects still worked exactly as described in documentation, and mimic a proper object oriented design as much as is possible with a language like Javascript.

All in all, the strongest part of PlanMe's development was the team. While obviously uncoordinated, each member put in the work that they needed to, and most importantly, everyone was willing to help. Each member was present throughout development, and everyone pulled their weight.

<h1>Challenges in Development:</h1>
PlanMe's development, like most projects, were ridden with challenges. The two largest challenges from each team were chosen, with an idea given for how we would solve this issue given the chance to start again.

<h1>Architecture</h1>

<b>Communication From Other Teams</b>
Because the documentation had to be written before implementation, the Architecture team had to make a lot of guesses while writing their documents. Decisions were not able to be made about many things that they had to write about early in the semester.
<i>How should we have solved this?</i>
The Architecture team should've been given more power. This team should really have been given the final hand in design decisions. Whether this means different people should have been part of the team is another question. But what is for sure is that the people writing these design documents should have been the same people doing the designing.

<b>SQA</b>
PlanMe's SQA documents were not set up early enough in development. As such, the SQA was very behind and not properly used.
<i>How should we have solved this?</i>
There's really no excuse; we should have implemented SQA sooner. Had it been implemented sooner, we would have been able to make the process of SQA far more efficient than it was once it was implemented. 

<h1>Front End</h1>

<b>Individual Views Uncoordinated</b>
In attempting to complete views, the team were not able to coordinate with each other on how to make their views look to stay artistically consistent with each other.
<i>How should we have solved this?</i>
Technically, the problem was solved by the final reformat of each of the views. However, we believe we should have solved this differently. Our best proposed plan would be to have had the full Front End team meet and collaborate on one main view. This view, featuring input from every team member, could have been used as a basis for each other view. This would allow other team members to work individually while staying as consistent with other views in development.

<b>Learning</b>
Many members of our team had little to no experience in Front End development. Our lack of infrastructure for training throughout the entire PlanMe team proved to be a huge burden on a few members of the Front End team.
<i>How should we have solved this?</i>
We should definitely have organized training sessions, where the members with the required knowledge would have been able to pass down their knowledge to the members new to this part of development.

<h1>Back End</h1>

<b>Object Oriented Design</b>
We were forced to butcher javascript practices to attempt an object oriented design using our chose technology stack.
<i>How should we have solved this?</i>
Many of the team members agree that this project should have been done using a different language in the back end. As much as most of us dislike the language, the given requirements of the project were likely best suited to Java using something like Spring.

<b>Learning</b>
Precisely like the Front End team, we had a few team members with no knowledge of our chosen technology stack coming into the project.
<i>How should we have solved this?</i>
Similarly to the front end team, we should have had more coordination with meetings dedicated to training. The back end team did attempt this, but our training was never done properly. We likely should have come up with some method of training the team members that would allow them to learn on their own time more easily.

<h1>Managerial</h1>

<b>Scheduling</b>
We did not implement any sense of scheduling and hour logging in our group. It didn't end up being a problem for accountability as everyone did their work, but it was a problem for keeping deadlines organized.
<i>How should we have solved this?</i>
There were plans that were never put in motion to have an individual time tracking sheet. We should have followed through on that.

<b>No Direction</b>
These words have been said a few times in this document: The PlanMe team lacked direction. This lack of direction caused the implementation phase to move extremely slowly, to the point where we did not a project that could definitely have been within our capacity to complete.
<i>How should we have solved this?</i>
We tried constantly throughout the semester to alleviate this problem and never came up with a solution. The greatest thing we probably could have done would be to have picked a proper leader. Not someone who is necessarily the boss of everyone, but there should have been a more clearly defined leader who made decisions on who would do things and keep people accountable. Perhaps even something like a Human Resources team could have helped our situation. 

Given the ability to do this whole project again, having a more organized sense of direction would solve many of the issues we had, and it is the number on thing we could fix. Given the circumstances however, we still are proud of what we managed to accomplish.
