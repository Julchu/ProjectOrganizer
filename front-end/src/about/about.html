                <h2 style="float:left">PlanMe is a web application that acts as a tool to allow groups to organize themselves to efficiently delegate work to its members and reach project goals on time. This is achieved by following the Kanban (Japanese for "billboard") methodology - an agile method of project management focusing on the visualization of workflows, balancing demand and a team's resources for maximum efficiency.<br><br></h2>
                <h2 style="float:left">Users have individual accounts to distribute project tasks. Users are able to maneuver through different subsections of the project in order to see which tasks are yet to be done, what's already in progress and what's already completed. In summary, PlanMe serves as an online project management platform that focuses on synchronized workflows to complete shared tasks.<br><br></h2>
